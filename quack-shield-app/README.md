# ğŸ›¸ QuackGuard App (Vite + React + TS)

The flight deck UI of the QuackGuard starship. Here operators configure agents, observe live moderation streams, and trigger on-chain appeals.

## Directory Star Map

- public/
  - Static assets served as-is (icons, manifest). No build-time processing.
- src/
  - Source code for the UI and client logic.
  - components/
    - ChatFeed.tsx â€” Renders the live message stream with states (Normal â†’ Flagged â†’ Verified/Removed). Shows transitions and statuses.
    - ChatMessage.tsx â€” A single message card with badges, actions (appeal), and AI tooltips.
    - ConfigurationPanel.tsx â€” Control panel to toggle agents and rules; shows ChainGPT AI connection and usage stats.
    - Modal.tsx â€” Generic modal for dialogs (e.g., appeals).
  - hooks/
    - useDuckChain.ts â€” React hook that encapsulates DuckChain wallet/session, appeals, and tx tracking.
  - integration/
    - useChainGPTProxy.ts â€” Simulated ChainGPT uplink: connects, tracks active analyses, and returns heuristic analysis.
  - types/
    - models.ts â€” App domain models: Message, AgentsConfig, RulesConfig, UIState.
    - blockchain.ts â€” Type definitions for DuckChain connection, transactions, and errors.
    - chaingpt-ambient.d.ts â€” Ambient declarations bridging to chaingpt-integration types.
  - utils/
    - agents.ts â€” Local agent heuristics to flag messages (e.g., links/spam/keywords).
    - duckchain.ts â€” Client-side service wrapper used by useDuckChain; formats addresses/balances.
  - data/
    - mockData.ts â€” Seed messages for the demo stream.
  - App.tsx â€” Main application shell wiring components, state, and flows.
  - main.tsx â€” React entrypoint; bootstraps Tailwind and mounts App.
  - App.css, index.css â€” Stylesheets (Tailwind layer + component overrides).
- dist/
  - Production build output generated by Vite. Do not edit manually.

## Flight Systems

- Agent Swarm Simulation
  - UI-level heuristics emulate Moderator and Verifier agents
  - Optional ChainGPT assist enhances confidence and rationale

- Onâ€‘Chain Appeals (Sim or Real)
  - useDuckChain abstracts wallet connect, staking, and appeal reads
  - UI renders status: pending, confirmed, failed

- Telemetry & UX
  - Usage stats for AI analyses, non-blocking UI with optimistic updates, and graceful error surfacing

## Runbook

- Dev
  - npm install
  - npm run dev â†’ opens http://localhost:5173
- Build
  - npm run build â†’ outputs to /dist
- Preview
  - npm run preview

## Configuration

- Tailwind scanning: tailwind.config.js includes ./src/**/*
- TypeScript project refs: tsconfig.app.json includes src
- Env (optional): provide ChainGPT keys and DuckChain RPC via top-level configuration if wiring to real services

## Signals & Contracts

- Message status lifecycle: normal â†’ flagged_by_moderator â†’ verified_by_verifier
- Appeal status (from blockchain types): queued â†’ voting â†’ resolved

> Status: Primary user interface. If the bridge goes dark, the crew flies blind.
