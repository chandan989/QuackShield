# ðŸš€ ChainGPT Integration Bay

In the neon-lit hull of QuackGuardâ€™s starship, this module is the comms uplink to ChainGPTâ€”an AI co-processor that augments moderation intelligence. Think of it as a quantum copilot that helps classify, enrich, or explain what our agents detect.

## Directory Star Map

- hooks/
  - Reusable React/TypeScript hooks to talk to ChainGPT services, manage async calls, and cache results.
- types/
  - Strongly-typed interfaces for request/response payloads, configuration, and error envelopes.
- utils/
  - Low-level helpers: HTTP clients, retriers, rate-limit guards, and response normalizers.

## Functional Systems

- Request Pipeline
  - Build typed requests from moderation events (message text, metadata, rule snapshots)
  - Send to ChainGPT endpoint with timeouts and retries
  - Normalize outputs (scores, labels, rationales) for downstream agents

- Caching & Idempotency
  - Short-lived caches to prevent duplicate calls during rapid-fire streams
  - Stable request hashing for dedupe & observability

- Error Containment
  - Circuit-breaker pattern on repeated failures
  - Typed error bubbles surfaced to UI and logging

## Example Flight Path (Pseudo)

```ts
const { analyzeWithChainGPT } = useChainGpTUplink();
const res = await analyzeWithChainGPT({ content, locale, policy });
if (res.kind === 'ok') {
  updateModeratorSignal(res.data.signal);
} else {
  reportTelemetry(res.error);
}
```

## Configuration

- Environment
  - CHAIN_GPT_API_URL: Base endpoint
  - CHAIN_GPT_API_KEY: Service token
- Tunables
  - request timeout, retry backoff, max tokens, temperature (if LM-backed)

## Safety & Privacy

- Redact PII before egress
- Log hashes, not raw messages
- Respect rate limits to avoid uplink blackouts

## When To Use

- You want richer context than heuristics alone
- You need rationales to display in appeal flows
- Youâ€™re running A/B experiments on model-assisted moderation

## Known Limitations

- External dependency: plan for degraded mode
- Latency spikes under load: always keep a local fallback

> Status: Optional augmentation. The ship flies without itâ€”but this bay makes it smarter.
